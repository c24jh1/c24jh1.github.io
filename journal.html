<p class="main">So far in computer science, I have learned a lot about coding! I didn't know how to do any of this before so it's been challenging but I feel like I am starting to understand and memorise things! Using terminal has been the most challanging for be because it is very precise. So far, I am very proud of my website and hope to make it even better in the future!</p>

<p class="main">This week I worked on adding more designs to my website. I added shadows, icons, etc but am even more excited to start working on my projects! I have started my code sketches for both the painting project I'm thinking of and the quiz idea. Since I don't have any projects yet, I put a temporary "neon" sign there just so it wasn't left blank. I also made this page a gradient scroll so when more entries are on here there will be a gradient as you scroll but for now its going to just look like this but I hope it'll look cooler in the future. I'm excited to keep on adding to my website!</p>

<p class="main">When I started cs1 this year, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. By the end of the first week, I had already learned so much! After the first month, I had the basics of my website and was having so much fun! Then, I learned how to add designs and make the website more me which I love! That has been my favorite part so far this year! The project that I think is extremely difficult but hope to accomplish soon is my painting game! I struggle with javascript a lot and that involves a lot of javascript. The thing I think I've gotten the best at so far this year is terminal. It used to be super hard for me, but now it is muscle memory and I can do it practically in my sleep! One thing I hope to add is some fun interactive or something to my homepage. I think it is a little too plain and simple right now and I hope that with a little fun game or click around, I can make it a little more fun than it already is! I really hope that by the end of T3 I will understand javascript better, and that my website will look absolutely amazing!</p>

<p class="main">This week I learned how to make an animation! It was super difficult but I think I am figuring it out! I still super don't understand javascript but I'm trying... I ended up leaving the neons for my projects but having that say what my projects are! I am still super determined to make my painting game once I figure out how to do it! For now, I have still just coded the pallet but I think that looks pretty cool so far! I am also working on having an interactive on my home page because it is looking very blank and I am not a fan of that. I hope it will look super good soon!</p>
